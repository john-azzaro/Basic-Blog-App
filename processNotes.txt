Basic Blog App Process notes
============================


Objective
=========
In this study, we'll make a basic blog application with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) 
functionality and implement mongoose so that we can store our information to a MongoDB database. I'm going
to go step-by-step through the process to both guide learners and document the process for myself in an 
effort to improve workflow.
